👥 Friend Function in C++ – Brief Explanation
A friend function in C++ is a function that is not a member of a class but is given special access to the private and protected members of that class.

🔐 Why Use Friend Function?
Normally, private and protected members of a class can only be accessed by member functions of the same class.
But when you need a non-member function (or another class) to access these members, you can declare it as a friend.

✅ Syntax:
class MyClass {
    private:
        int data;
    public:
        MyClass() { data = 10; }
        friend void showData(MyClass obj); // friend function declaration
};

✅ Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class MyClass {
private:
    int secret = 42;
public:
    friend void reveal(MyClass obj); // Friend function
};
void reveal(MyClass obj) {
    // Can access private members
    cout << "Secret is: " << obj.secret << endl;
}
int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    reveal(obj);
    return 0;
}

/*
Output:
Secret is: 42
*/

🧠 Key Points:
Defined outside the class but declared inside with the friend keyword.
It breaks encapsulation slightly, so use it only when needed.
Can be a normal function or a member of another class.
