🔍 Data Abstraction vs Encapsulation in C++

✅ Data Abstraction:

Hides internal implementation and shows only necessary details.
Focuses on what an object does.
Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, and access specifiers.
Example: Declaring a method without exposing its logic.
Helps simplify complexity and improve code readability.

✅ Encapsulation:

Binds data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
Focuses on how data is accessed and protected.
Achieved using access specifiers like private, public, and protected.
Example: Using private variables and public getter/setter functions.
Ensures data security and integrit.

📌 Key Difference:

Abstraction hides the implementation.
Encapsulation hides the data.
