Types Of Inheritance in C++
The inheritance can be classified on the basis of the relationship between the derived class and the base class. In C++, we have 5 types of inheritances:

ðŸ”¹ Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, one derived class inherits from one base class.
eg:-
Base
 |
 v
Derived
Definition:
A class is derived from a single base class. This is the simplest form of inheritance.

ðŸ”¹ Multilevel Inheritance
In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a derived class.
eg:-
Base
 |
 v
Derived1
 |
 v
Derived2
Definition:
A class is derived from another class which is already derived from a base class, forming a chain.

ðŸ”¹ Multiple Inheritance
In multiple inheritance, one class inherits from more than one base class.
eg:-
Base1     Base2
   \       /
    \     /
     v   v
    Derived
Definition:
A class is derived from two or more base classes.

ðŸ”¹ Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
eg:-
       Base
      /   \
     v     v
Derived1 Derived2
Definition:
Several classes are derived from one base class.

ðŸ”¹ Hybrid Inheritance
In hybrid inheritance, a combination of more than one type of inheritance is used (e.g., multiple + multilevel).
eg:-
       Base
      /    \
     v      v
Derived1  Derived2
     \     /
      v   v
     FinalDerived
Definition:
A combination of two or more types of inheritance in a single program.
