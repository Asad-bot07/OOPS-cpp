# 🧠 OOP in C++

This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It's useful for students, beginners, or anyone revising OOP in C++.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The theoretical explanations included in this repository have been collected from various internet sources and websites for educational purposes only.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors & Destructors
- Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)
- Polymorphism (Function Overloading, Virtual Functions)
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Operator Overloading
- File Handling with Classes

## 📁 Structure
- 🔹 Chapter 1: Basics (Hello World, Variables, I/O)
- 🔹 Chapter 2: Control Structures (if-else, loops, switch)
- 🔹 Chapter 3: Arrays & Functions (recursion, strings)
- 🔹 Chapter 4: OOP Begins! (Classes & Objects)
- 🔹 Chapter 5: The four pillars of OOPs .
- 🔹 Chapter 6: Data Abstraction(theory+code).
- 🔹 Chapter 7: Encapsulation(theory+code).
- 🔹 Chapter 8: Polymorphism(Theory+code).
- 🔹 Chapter 9: Inheritance(Theory+code).
- 🔹 Chapter 10: Templates
- 🔹 Chapter 11: Vectors
- 🔹 Chapter 12: File handling
- 🔹 Practice codes(written by me personally)
> CPP completed
